        { id: 9, question: "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?", answer: "An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods (until Java 8)." },
        { id: 10, question: "What is a deadlock in multithreading?", answer: "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources." },
        { id: 11, question: "Explain the Singleton pattern.", answer: "The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance." },
        { id: 12, question: "What is Java's 'final' keyword?", answer: "'final' in Java is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance." },
        { id: 13, question: "What is SQL injection?", answer: "SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL queries." },
        { id: 14, question: "What are the advantages of using Git?", answer: "Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaboration, history tracking, and easy merging of code changes." },
        { id: 15, question: "What is Polymorphism in OOP?", answer: "Polymorphism allows a subclass object to be treated as an object of its superclass, enabling different behaviors based on the object's type." },
        { id: 16, question: "What is Dependency Injection?", answer: "Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control, where dependencies are provided from outside instead of being created inside a class." },
        { id: 17, question: "Explain the difference between Compile-time and Runtime polymorphism.", answer: "Compile-time polymorphism is achieved via method overloading, while runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding." },
        { id: 18, question: "What is a hashmap in Java?", answer: "A HashMap is a collection class that stores key-value pairs, allowing fast lookups, additions, and deletions." },

     questions: [
        { id: 1, question: "What is polymorphism in OOP?", answer: "Polymorphism allows an object to take many forms. It is achieved through method overloading and method overriding." },
        { id: 2, question: "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?", answer: "An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface only has abstract methods (until Java 8)." },
        { id: 3, question: "What is dependency injection?", answer: "Dependency injection is a design pattern where an object’s dependencies are provided from outside rather than creating them internally." },
        { id: 4, question: "What is Agile methodology?", answer: "Agile methodology focuses on iterative development and collaboration, with frequent delivery of small, functional software increments." },
        { id: 5, question: "Explain the concept of exception handling in Java.", answer: "Exception handling in Java is done using 'try-catch' blocks to manage runtime errors and maintain the flow of the program." },
        { id: 6, question: "What is a thread in Java?", answer: "A thread is a lightweight process that allows multitasking, enabling a program to perform multiple operations concurrently." },
        { id: 7, question: "What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?", answer: "ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array and provides faster random access, while LinkedList is a doubly linked list and is faster for insertions/deletions." },
        { id: 8, question: "What is a singleton pattern?", answer: "The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance and provides a global access point." },
        { id: 9, question: "What is REST?", answer: "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for distributed systems, using standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations." },
        { id: 10, question: "What is the difference between a process and a thread?", answer: "A process is an independent program in execution, while a thread is a sub-process within a process." },
        { id: 11, question: "What is cloud computing?", answer: "Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources (e.g., storage, processing power) over the internet." },
        { id: 12, question: "What is SQL Injection?", answer: "SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL queries." },
        { id: 13, question: "What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE in SQL?", answer: "DELETE removes rows from a table with a condition, while TRUNCATE removes all rows and cannot be rolled back." },
        { id: 14, question: "Explain JPA (Java Persistence API).", answer: "JPA is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications using object-relational mapping (ORM) techniques." },
        { id: 15, question: "What is the use of Java's 'final' keyword?", answer: "The 'final' keyword is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance." },
        { id: 16, question: "What is a database index?", answer: "A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table." },
        { id: 17, question: "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?", answer: "Synchronous programming waits for a task to complete before moving to the next, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently." },
        { id: 18, question: "What is the importance of Agile Scrum in software development?", answer: "Agile Scrum emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and delivering small, incremental improvements to the product in short cycles." },
        { id: 19, question: "What is a HashMap?", answer: "A HashMap is a collection class that stores key-value pairs and provides fast lookups based on keys." },
        { id: 20, question: "What is Kubernetes?", answer: "Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications." },
        { id: 21, question: "What is load balancing?", answer: "Load balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance." },

        { id: 15, question: "Explain k-means clustering.", answer: "K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster." },
        { id: 16, question: "What is regularization in machine learning?", answer: "Regularization techniques, like L1 and L2, add penalty terms to the cost function to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting." },
        { id: 17, question: "What is a confusion matrix?", answer: "A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm by showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives." },

        { id: 19, question: "What is the difference between bagging and boosting?", answer: "Bagging reduces variance by averaging models, while boosting reduces bias by focusing on correcting errors made by previous models." },
